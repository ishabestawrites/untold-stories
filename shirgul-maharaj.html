    <h1>SHIRGUL DEVTA -THE SACRED GUARDIAN</h1>
   
    <p>
      




This story comes from the thirteenth century, during the time when Sultans ruled India. In those days, Delhi was ruled by the Turks, who were called the Slave Dynasty. Their rule lasted from 1206 AD to 1290 AD.

Old stories passed down through generations talk about wars fought with the Turks. These events are also remembered in the ways people worship their deities. From these traditions, it is believed that Shri Shirgul Dev and his brothers and sisters took birth during the early period of Turkish rule, between 1206 and 1210 AD. These divine souls came to earth during this time.
<br>
<br>

In Sirmaur district, in Rajgarh tehsil, there is a village called Shaya, about eighteen kilometers from Rajgarh on the Rajgarh–Habban road. This village was ruled by King Bhukru. The king lived a good life, but he was very sad because he had no children. He tried many ways to have a child, but nothing worked.
<br>
<br>


At the same time, a holy man of the Nath tradition, Yogi 1008 Guru Itwar Nath Maharaj, lived near Rajgarh at a place called Thaur Nivad. He had been doing deep meditation there for many years. Because of his spiritual powers, people respected him greatly.

Feeling helpless, King Bhukru went to Guru Itwar Nath Maharaj and asked him for help. The Guru used his divine vision and told the king that in Kashmir lived a very wise man named Desh Nath Kaul, also called Deshu Pandit. He could find the reason for not having children and suggest a solution. The Guru advised the king to go to Kashmir.

With hope in his heart, King Bhukru started his journey to Kashmir. The journey was very long—about seven hundred kilometers—and he traveled on foot, crossing rough roads, high mountains, and difficult paths. After many days, he finally reached Kashmir.
<br>
<br>


There, King Bhukru met Deshu Pandit. He offered him a gold gift shaped like a custard apple and told him his sad story with tears in his eyes. Deshu Pandit was a devotee of Lord Shiva and knew tantric practices and astrology. After listening carefully, he told the king that there was a problem in his household destiny. He said that to solve it, the king would need to marry a woman from a Brahmin family.

Deshu Pandit then performed a sacred fire ritual (havan) for the king to bless him with children. He gave the king the ash from the fire and some dry fruits and sweets blessed with holy chants. He told the king to give these to both queens. He also said that even the first queen might become pregnant, and the child born would be bright, strong, and divine.
<br>
<br>

Still worried, King Bhukru returned home. After reaching his palace, he told his dear queen Dayamanti everything, including the matter of a second marriage. The queen listened and said kindly,
<br>
<br>

“I will not feel sad if another queen comes. I will be happy if you are blessed with a child.”
<br>
After this, Queen Dayamanti went to a nearby village called Manon. With tears in her eyes, she told her sorrow to Shri Loj Pandit and asked for his sister Dhudhma to be married to the king.
<br>
<br>

After the marriage, the holy sweets and dry fruits given by the Pandit in Kashmir were given to both queens. By God’s blessing, both queens became pregnant. In this way, the path was prepared for the birth of Shri Shirgul Dev.
<br>
<br>


After King Bhukru’s second marriage, he gave the fruit, sweets, and dry fruits that were given by the Brahmin in Kashmir to both his queens. Because of their divine effect, after some time both queens gave birth to divine sons.
<br>
The son born to Queen Dhudhma was the first son of her lineage, so he was named Shirgul*.
Queen Dayamanti, however, gave birth while traveling from Sarah. On the way, at a place called Saranhatti, which is about eight kilometers from Shaya, a flash of lightning came down from the sky and entered her womb. Because of this divine event, a child was born. Since he was born through the power of lightning (vajra), he was named Bajat.
<br><br>

In time, Queen Dhudhma had three children, and Queen Dayamanti had two, making five children in total.
The second son of Queen Dhudhma had a face as bright and beautiful as the moon, so he was named Chandreshwar. Her daughter was named Kuj Aat.
Queen Dayamanti’s daughter, who was the real sister of Bajat Maharaj, was named Bijai.
<br><br>

King Bhukru was filled with great joy, but fate did not allow his happiness to last long. After a short time, Queen Dayamanti passed away and went to heaven. Once again, sorrow fell heavily upon King Bhukru.

After discussing the matter with Guru Itwar Nath Ji, King Bhukru decided to go on a pilgrimage to the four holy dhams as repentance for marrying into a Brahmin family. Queen Dhudhma also expressed her wish to go with him.
<br><br>

Because of this, the children were separated.
<br>
<br>

The children of Queen Dayamanti were taken to Saran by their maternal grandfather Devi Singh, also known as Devu Thakur.
<br>
<br>
The children of Queen Dhudhma were taken by their maternal uncle Loj Pandit to his home in Manon.
<br>
<br>

King Bhukru handed over all the responsibilities of the kingdom to his minister Deviram. In this way, King Bhukru and Queen Dhudhma gave up royal life and left for the four-dham pilgrimage.
<br>
<br>

The wife of Loj Pandit was a Brahmin woman who was selfish and cruel by nature. She did not want these children to be brought to Manon or cared for. She began to torture them.
When the children went to graze animals, she gave them only dry sattu balls and stale bread to eat. If the animals remained hungry or returned home early, the children were beaten. Many attempts were made to drive them out of the house and even kill them, but the one who protects is always stronger than the one who tries to harm. All her attempts failed.
<br>
When the children grew a little older, all household work was forced upon them. Once, during plowing season in Phagu Kyar, 17–18 plowmen were called to work the fields. Shirgul worked just as hard as the others.

When it was time for food, the Brahmin woman brought food with ghee for the other workers, but gave the children sattu balls mixed with flies and insects. Everyone saw this and was shocked, but no one dared to speak.
<br>
<br>
Shirgul then said,
“Aunt, if you brought sattu, you should have brought water for washing hands.”
<br>
<br>
She replied harshly,
“If you are so pure, why don’t you create water yourself?”
<br>
<br>
These words hurt Shirgul deeply. In anger, he struck the ground with his foot, and a stream of water began to flow. The children took the animals toward Tali Teesri, and rubbed the sattu balls on stones. Even today, marks of flies’ wings can still be seen on those stones.

Soon, Chandreshwar became very hungry. In anger, Shirgul told him to take the animals home. Chandreshwar replied that he would not be able to take them so quickly. Hearing this, Shirgul struck the ground with his knee, and a cave was formed. Many animals entered the cave. The animals that did not enter were turned into stone by Shirgul.

Shirgul then told Chandreshwar to take the animals home, and he himself disappeared. Dark clouds covered the sky, and darkness spread everywhere.

<br>
<br>
When Chandreshwar reached home and called the Brahmin woman to tie the animals, she entered the cattle shed. There, the ropes turned into snakes, and with the loud buzzing of bees, the vehicle of Goddess Kali appeared. Shirgul’s younger sister also received divine power, took the form of a bhramari (bee form), joined the swarm, and disappeared.

In this way, thousands of bees attacked the Brahmin woman, devoured her body, and sent her to Yampuri. A terrible hailstorm struck Shaya, destroying all crops. When Shirgul Dev’s anger finally calmed, the clouds cleared and sunlight returned.

Shri Shirgul Dev appeared in Manon, and his younger sister also appeared again in human form. Seeing these miracles, people were astonished. The news spread like the wind across the nine regions, and people gathered in Manon.

According to local beliefs, Shirgul Maharaj’s aunt was skilled in witchcraft and tantric powers. She misused these powers and tried to kill the divine children to gain control over the land. She even tried to poison them. Because of her cruel and unrighteous actions, these divine powers ended her life during the children’s early years.


<br>
<br>

When people saw these miracles, they were amazed. The news spread like a gust of wind across all nine regions, and people gathered in Manon. After this, Shirgul and the other children were taken to Shaya, where Shirgul was crowned king.

Shirgul Maharaj stayed in Shaya. Chandreshwar and his younger sister, whose name had not been formally given, went with their maternal uncle Loj Pandit to Manon for care. Because this sister lived among cows, people began calling her Gara. Later, she became known as Garai or Gudli.

At that time, a demon named Chudiya Danav lived in Churdhar. He spread great fear and began killing people and their cattle in nearby villages. Terrified, the people came to Shirgul Dev and shared their suffering.

Shirgul Dev came to Saran, informed Bajat Dev about the demon’s terror, and then set out for Churdhar. A fierce battle took place between Bajat Dev and Chudiya Danav. In the end, the demon tried to escape from Churdhar, but Bajat Dev blocked his path. The demon attacked Bajat Dev, and Bajat Dev fell unconscious.

<br>
<br>
When Shirgul Dev saw his brother unconscious, he was overcome with grief and also fainted. People cried in fear. After some time, both brothers regained consciousness, and divine power awakened fully in Bajat Dev, who took his deity form.

Shirgul Dev then picked up a pinch of soil from the earth and threw it into the sky. The Lord of Clouds appeared. When Shirgul Dev threw another pinch of soil, lightning struck, and the clouds chased the demon and destroyed him.

From that time on, Shirgul Dev’s fame kept growing. Whenever people were troubled by spirits, ghosts, demons, or dark forces, Shirgul Dev freed them. His glory spread across all regions and even reached Delhi.

<br>
<br>
At that time, Delhi was under Turkish rule. Secret spies informed the Sultan that a man named Shirgul possessed divine powers. The Delhi rulers called him for a special meeting.

Shirgul Dev, Chandreshwar, and 30–40 companions traveled to Delhi. When they reached the banks of the Yamuna River, the Turkish rulers tested them. They sent a butcher to kill a cow, while spies watched secretly.

As the butcher raised his weapon, the blow did not hit the cow. Instead, the butcher’s own head was cut off, and it fell at the feet of Shirgul Dev. Many other miraculous events occurred. The spies reported everything to the Delhi court.

The Delhi rulers became afraid and ordered Shirgul Dev and his companions to be chained with leather shackles and imprisoned. In the same prison were Doom Dev, Mahasu Bagad, Gugga Chauhan, and others, all bound in leather chains.

<br>
<br>
Shirgul Dev introduced himself, and everyone shared their suffering. They discussed how to escape. Shirgul Dev noticed a woman sweeper (jamadar) and asked her to bring a sharp knife. The next morning, she secretly passed the knife through the window.

Shirgul Dev said that whoever cuts the chains would be more powerful than all of them and would be worshipped everywhere. Gugga Pir held the knife in his mouth and cut Shirgul Dev’s chains. Soon, all prisoners were freed, and they escaped.

When they reached an open field near a peepal tree, Turkish soldiers attacked. Shirgul Dev threw dust from the earth, and the soldiers began seeing each other as enemies and killed one another. Many soldiers died, while Shirgul Dev and his companions remained unharmed.

Frightened, the Turkish rulers begged for forgiveness, which Shirgul Dev granted. At that moment, a small stone message came from Churdhar, saying danger had returned. Shirgul Dev said they must return quickly.

<br>
<br>
The Turks gifted them horses, and Shirgul Dev was given a spotted mare. As they were leaving, Bhang, Shirgul’s sister, appeared and insisted on going with him. Shirgul Dev threw a pinch of earth toward her, and she gained divine power. Wherever she went, beings died instantly. Seeing this destruction, Shirgul Dev took back her power and warned her. She promised to act only when called.

Shirgul Dev returned to Shaya, where people welcomed him. Plans were made to attack Churdhar again. During the journey, many demons were defeated. At one narrow mountain path, Shirgul Dev turned the spotted mare into stone, which is still worshipped today.

At Churdhar, a fierce battle took place with Chaukhat Danav. Shirgul Dev struck him with his sword, cutting off his head. The sword struck a rock, leaving a mark that still exists today. The demon’s head fell there, while his body disappeared and fell at Chhajpur, where it is still known today.

<br>
<br>
After this, Churdhar became free from fear. People wished to make Chur Chandni a pilgrimage site, but there was no water. Shirgul Dev brought water from Manasarovar, making it a holy place for the welfare of the people.

After completing his divine duties, Shirgul Dev returned to the supreme realm. Bajat Dev, Chandreshwar Dev, Gudai, Bijai, and Bhangayani took their rightful places. Temples were built, idols were made, and worship began. People were freed from fear of ghosts, spirits, and dark forces.

Later rulers came and went—Khiljis, Tughlaqs, and others—many temples were destroyed, and idols were hidden underground. After Sher Shah Suri, temples were rebuilt, idols were rediscovered, and worship resumed. Even today, idols of Bajat Maharaj, Gudai, Bijai, Shirgul Dev, and Chandreshwar Dev have been found in caves and fields, where temples now stand and prayers continue.

  <h2>शिरगुल देव की कथा</h2>
  <p>

यह कथा तेरहवीं शताब्दी की है, उस समय की जब भारत में सुल्तानों का शासन था। उन दिनों दिल्ली पर तुर्कों का शासन था, जिन्हें दास वंश के शासक कहा जाता है। उनका शासनकाल 1206 ईस्वी से 1290 ईस्वी तक रहा।

पीढ़ी-दर-पीढ़ी चली आ रही जनश्रुतियों में तुर्कों के साथ हुए युद्धों का वर्णन मिलता है। इन घटनाओं की स्मृति लोगों की देवी-देवताओं की पूजा-पद्धतियों में भी दिखाई देती है। इन्हीं परंपराओं के आधार पर यह विश्वास किया जाता है कि श्री शिरगुल देव तथा उनके भाई-बहनों का जन्म तुर्की शासन के प्रारंभिक काल, लगभग 1206 से 1210 ईस्वी के बीच हुआ। यही वह समय था जब ये दिव्य आत्माएँ पृथ्वी पर अवतरित हुईं।
<br>
<br>

सिरमौर ज़िले के राजगढ़ तहसील में, राजगढ़–हब्बन मार्ग पर राजगढ़ से लगभग अठारह किलोमीटर दूर, शाया नामक एक गाँव है। इस गाँव पर राजा भुक्करू का शासन था। राजा का जीवन सुखमय था, किंतु वह निःसंतान होने के कारण अत्यंत दुखी रहता था। संतान प्राप्ति के लिए उसने अनेक प्रयास किए, परंतु कोई उपाय सफल नहीं हुआ।
<br>
<br>

उसी समय नाथ संप्रदाय के एक महान संत, योगी 1008 गुरु इटवर नाथ महाराज, राजगढ़ के समीप थौर निवाड़ नामक स्थान पर रहते थे। वे वहाँ कई वर्षों से गहन तपस्या में लीन थे। अपनी आध्यात्मिक सिद्धियों के कारण वे अत्यंत पूजनीय माने जाते थे।

असहाय होकर राजा भुक्करू गुरु इटवर नाथ महाराज के पास पहुँचे और अपनी व्यथा सुनाई। गुरुजी ने अपनी दिव्य दृष्टि से देखकर बताया कि कश्मीर में देश नाथ कौल नामक एक महान ज्ञानी रहते हैं, जिन्हें देशू पंडित भी कहा जाता है। वे निःसंतानता का कारण जानकर समाधान बता सकते हैं। गुरुजी ने राजा को कश्मीर जाने की सलाह दी।

हृदय में आशा लेकर राजा भुक्करू कश्मीर की यात्रा पर निकल पड़े। यह यात्रा लगभग सात सौ किलोमीटर की थी, जिसे उन्होंने पैदल ही तय किया। दुर्गम मार्गों, ऊँचे पर्वतों और कठिन रास्तों को पार करते हुए, कई दिनों बाद वे कश्मीर पहुँचे।

वहाँ राजा की भेंट देशू पंडित से हुई। उन्होंने सोने का एक उपहार, जो शरीफ़ा (सीताफल) के आकार का था, अर्पित किया और अश्रुपूर्ण नेत्रों से अपनी कथा सुनाई। देशू पंडित भगवान शिव के उपासक थे तथा तंत्र-मंत्र और ज्योतिष विद्या में निपुण थे। ध्यानपूर्वक सुनने के बाद उन्होंने बताया कि राजा के गृहभाग्य में दोष है। उसका समाधान यह है कि राजा को ब्राह्मण कुल की कन्या से विवाह करना होगा।

देशू पंडित ने राजा के लिए संतान-प्राप्ति हेतु एक पवित्र हवन किया। हवन की भस्म तथा मंत्रों से अभिमंत्रित सूखे मेवे और मिष्ठान राजा को दिए और कहा कि इन्हें दोनों रानियों को दें। उन्होंने यह भी कहा कि पहली रानी को भी संतान हो सकती है और वह संतान तेजस्वी, शक्तिशाली तथा दिव्य होगी।

कुछ चिंतित मन से राजा भुक्करू अपने राज्य लौट आए। महल पहुँचकर उन्होंने अपनी प्रिय रानी दयामंती को सारी बात बताई, जिसमें दूसरे विवाह का विषय भी शामिल था। रानी ने शांत भाव से कहा—
<br>
<br>
“यदि दूसरी रानी आती हैं तो मुझे कोई दुःख नहीं होगा। यदि आपको संतान की प्राप्ति होती है तो मैं स्वयं को धन्य समझूँगी।”

इसके पश्चात रानी दयामंती पास के गाँव मानों गईं और आँसुओं के साथ अपनी पीड़ा श्री लोज पंडित को सुनाई। उन्होंने उनसे अपनी बहन धुधमा का विवाह राजा से कराने का अनुरोध किया।

विवाह के बाद कश्मीर से लाए गए पवित्र मिष्ठान और सूखे मेवे दोनों रानियों को दिए गए। ईश्वर की कृपा से दोनों रानियाँ गर्भवती हुईं। इस प्रकार श्री शिरगुल देव के अवतरण का मार्ग प्रशस्त हुआ।
<br>
<br>
राजा भुक्करू के दूसरे विवाह के बाद, कश्मीर के ब्राह्मण द्वारा दिए गए फल, मिष्ठान और सूखे मेवे दोनों रानियों को दिए गए। उनके दिव्य प्रभाव से कुछ समय बाद दोनों रानियों ने दिव्य पुत्रों को जन्म दिया।

रानी धुधमा से उत्पन्न पुत्र उनके वंश का प्रथम पुत्र था, इसलिए उसका नाम *शिरगुल* रखा गया।
रानी दयामंती ने सराह से यात्रा करते समय प्रसव किया। मार्ग में, शाया से लगभग आठ किलोमीटर दूर सरनहट्टी नामक स्थान पर आकाश से एक बिजली कौंधी और उनके गर्भ में प्रविष्ट हुई। इस दिव्य घटना से एक पुत्र का जन्म हुआ। वज्र (बिजली) की शक्ति से जन्म लेने के कारण उसका नाम बिज्जट रखा गया।
<br>
<br>

समय के साथ रानी धुधमा के तीन और रानी दयामंती के दो संतानें हुईं, इस प्रकार कुल पाँच संतानें हुईं।
रानी धुधमा के दूसरे पुत्र का मुख चंद्रमा के समान उज्ज्वल था, इसलिए उसका नाम *चंद्रेश्वर* रखा गया। उनकी पुत्री का नाम *कुज आत* था।
रानी दयामंती की पुत्री, जो बिज्जट महाराज की सगी बहन थीं, उनका नाम *बिजई* रखा गया।
<br>
<br>

राजा भुक्करू अत्यंत प्रसन्न थे, किंतु विधि को उनका सुख अधिक समय तक स्वीकार नहीं था। कुछ ही समय बाद रानी दयामंती का देहांत हो गया और वे स्वर्ग सिधार गईं। पुनः राजा भुक्करू पर दुःख का पहाड़ टूट पड़ा।

गुरु इटवर नाथ जी से विचार-विमर्श के बाद, राजा भुक्करू ने ब्राह्मण कुल में विवाह करने के प्रायश्चित स्वरूप चार धाम की यात्रा पर जाने का निश्चय किया। रानी धुधमा ने भी उनके साथ जाने की इच्छा प्रकट की।

इस कारण बच्चों का अलग-अलग पालन हुआ।
रानी दयामंती के बच्चे उनके नाना देवी सिंह, जिन्हें देवू ठाकुर भी कहा जाता था, अपने साथ सरन ले गए।
रानी धुधमा के बच्चों को उनके मामा लोज पंडित मानों अपने घर ले गए।
<br>
<br>

राजा भुक्करू ने राज्य की समस्त जिम्मेदारियाँ अपने मंत्री देवराम को सौंप दीं। इस प्रकार राजा भुक्करू और रानी धुधमा राजसी जीवन त्यागकर चार धाम की यात्रा पर निकल पड़े।
<br>
<br>

लोज पंडित की पत्नी स्वभाव से स्वार्थी और क्रूर ब्राह्मणी थी। वह बच्चों को मानों लाने और उनका पालन-पोषण करने के पक्ष में नहीं थी। उसने बच्चों पर अत्याचार करना शुरू कर दिया।
जब बच्चे पशु चराने जाते, तो उन्हें केवल सूखे सत्तू के लड्डू और बासी रोटियाँ दी जातीं। यदि पशु भूखे रहते या जल्दी लौट आते, तो बच्चों की पिटाई होती। उन्हें घर से निकालने और यहाँ तक कि मारने के भी अनेक प्रयास किए गए, परंतु रक्षक सदा भक्षक से अधिक शक्तिशाली होता है। उसके सभी प्रयास विफल हो गए।
<br>
<br>

जब बच्चे कुछ बड़े हुए, तो सारा घरेलू काम उन्हीं पर लाद दिया गया। एक बार फागू क्यार में जुताई के समय 17–18 हलवाहे खेत में काम कर रहे थे। शिरगुल भी उनके समान ही परिश्रम कर रहे थे।

भोजन के समय ब्राह्मणी अन्य हलवाहों के लिए घी-युक्त भोजन लाई, परंतु बच्चों को मक्खियों और कीड़ों से मिला सत्तू दिया। यह दृश्य देखकर सभी स्तब्ध रह गए, किंतु कोई कुछ कहने का साहस नहीं कर सका।
<br>
<br>

तब शिरगुल बोले—
<br>

“काकी, यदि सत्तू लाई हो तो हाथ धोने के लिए पानी भी लाना चाहिए था।”
<br>

उसने कठोरता से उत्तर दिया—
<br>
<br>

“यदि तुम इतने ही पवित्र हो तो स्वयं ही पानी उत्पन्न कर लो।”
<br>
<br>

ये शब्द शिरगुल के हृदय को भेद गए। क्रोध में उन्होंने पैर से भूमि पर प्रहार किया और वहाँ से जलधारा फूट पड़ी। बच्चे पशुओं को ताली तीसरी की ओर ले गए और सत्तू के लड्डुओं को पत्थरों पर रगड़ा। आज भी उन पत्थरों पर मक्खियों के पंखों के चिह्न दिखाई देते हैं।

कुछ समय बाद चंद्रेश्वर को अत्यधिक भूख लगी। क्रोधित होकर शिरगुल ने उनसे पशु घर ले जाने को कहा। चंद्रेश्वर ने कहा कि वे उन्हें इतनी जल्दी नहीं ले जा पाएँगे। यह सुनकर शिरगुल ने घुटने से भूमि पर प्रहार किया और वहाँ एक गुफा बन गई। अनेक पशु उसमें प्रवेश कर गए। जो पशु भीतर नहीं गए, उन्हें शिरगुल ने पत्थर का बना दिया।

इसके बाद शिरगुल ने चंद्रेश्वर से पशु घर ले जाने को कहा और स्वयं अंतर्धान हो गए। आकाश में काले बादल छा गए और चारों ओर अंधकार फैल गया।

जब चंद्रेश्वर घर पहुँचे और ब्राह्मणी को पशु बाँधने के लिए बुलाया, तो वह गौशाला में गई। वहाँ रस्सियाँ साँप बन गईं और मधुमक्खियों की भयानक गूँज के साथ माता काली का वाहन प्रकट हुआ। शिरगुल की छोटी बहन को भी दिव्य शक्ति प्राप्त हुई, वह भ्रामरी (मधुमक्खी रूप) में परिवर्तित होकर झुंड में सम्मिलित हो गई और अंतर्धान हो गई।

इस प्रकार हज़ारों मधुमक्खियों ने ब्राह्मणी पर आक्रमण किया, उसके शरीर को भस्म कर उसे यमपुरी पहुँचा दिया। शाया में भयंकर ओलावृष्टि हुई, जिससे सारी फसल नष्ट हो गई। जब शिरगुल देव का क्रोध शांत हुआ, तब बादल हटे और सूर्य का प्रकाश लौटा।<br>
<br>
<br>


श्री शिरगुल देव मानों में प्रकट हुए और उनकी छोटी बहन भी पुनः मानव रूप में दिखाई दी। इन चमत्कारों को देखकर लोग विस्मित रह गए। यह समाचार नौ खंडों में वायु की भाँति फैल गया और लोग मानों में एकत्र होने लगे।

स्थानीय मान्यताओं के अनुसार, शिरगुल महाराज की काकी तंत्र-मंत्र और जादू-टोने में निपुण थी। उसने इन शक्तियों का दुरुपयोग कर दिव्य बालकों को मारने का प्रयास किया ताकि भूमि पर अधिकार कर सके। उसने उन्हें विष देने का भी प्रयास किया। अपने क्रूर और अधार्मिक कर्मों के कारण, बालकों के अल्पायु काल में ही वही शक्तियाँ उसके विनाश का कारण बनीं।

इन चमत्कारों को देखकर लोग चकित रह गए। यह समाचार नौ खंडों में फैल गया और लोग मानों में एकत्र हुए। इसके बाद शिरगुल और अन्य बच्चों को शाया लाया गया, जहाँ शिरगुल का राज्याभिषेक किया गया।

शिरगुल महाराज शाया में ही रहे। चंद्रेश्वर और उनकी छोटी बहन, जिनका उस समय कोई औपचारिक नाम नहीं रखा गया था, अपने मामा लोज पंडित के साथ मानों चले गए। चूँकि यह बहन गायों के बीच रहती थी, इसलिए लोग उसे गरा कहने लगे। बाद में वह गराई या गुडली नाम से प्रसिद्ध हुई।

उस समय चूड़धार में चुड़िया दानव नामक एक राक्षस रहता था। वह अत्यंत आतंक फैलाता था और आसपास के गाँवों के लोगों व पशुओं की हत्या करता था। भयभीत होकर लोग शिरगुल देव के पास पहुँचे और अपना दुःख सुनाया।

शिरगुल देव सरन पहुँचे, बिज्जट देव को दानव के आतंक की सूचना दी और फिर चूड़धार की ओर प्रस्थान किया।बिज्जट  देव और चुड़िया दानव के बीच भयंकर युद्ध हुआ। अंत में दानव भागने लगा, किंतु बिज्जट देव ने उसका मार्ग रोक लिया। दानव ने बिज्जट देव पर आक्रमण किया और वे मूर्छित हो गए।
<br>
<br>

जब शिरगुल देव ने अपने भाई को अचेत देखा, तो वे शोक से व्याकुल होकर स्वयं भी मूर्छित हो गए। लोग भयभीत होकर रोने लगे। कुछ समय बाद दोनों भाई चेतना में आए और बिज्जट देव में पूर्ण रूप से दिव्य शक्ति जाग्रत हुई, जिससे उन्होंने देव रूप धारण किया।

शिरगुल देव ने भूमि से एक चुटकी मिट्टी उठाकर आकाश में फेंकी। बादलों के देव प्रकट हुए। दूसरी चुटकी मिट्टी फेंकते ही बिजली गिरी और बादलों ने दानव का पीछा कर उसका विनाश कर दिया।

तब से शिरगुल देव की कीर्ति बढ़ती चली गई। जब-जब लोग भूत-प्रेत, दानव या काली शक्तियों से पीड़ित होते, शिरगुल देव उन्हें मुक्त करते। उनकी महिमा चारों ओर फैलती हुई दिल्ली तक पहुँच गई।

<br>
<br>
उस समय दिल्ली पर तुर्कों का शासन था। गुप्तचरों ने सुल्तान को सूचना दी कि शिरगुल नामक व्यक्ति में दिव्य शक्तियाँ हैं। दिल्ली के शासकों ने उन्हें दरबार में बुलाया।

शिरगुल देव, चंद्रेश्वर और 30–40 साथी दिल्ली पहुँचे। यमुना नदी के तट पर तुर्क शासकों ने उनकी परीक्षा ली। एक कसाई को गाय काटने भेजा गया और गुप्तचर सब देख रहे थे।

जैसे ही कसाई ने वार किया, वह गाय पर नहीं पड़ा। उसका स्वयं का सिर कटकर शिरगुल देव के चरणों में आ गिरा। अनेक अन्य चमत्कार भी हुए। गुप्तचरों ने यह सब दरबार को बताया।

डरकर दिल्ली के शासकों ने शिरगुल देव और उनके साथियों को चमड़े की बेड़ियों में बाँधकर कारागार में डाल दिया। उसी कारागार में डूम देव, महासु बगड़, गुग्गा चौहान आदि भी बंद थे।

<br>
<br>
शिरगुल देव ने अपना परिचय दिया और सभी ने अपना दुःख साझा किया। उन्होंने पलायन की योजना बनाई। शिरगुल देव ने एक झाड़ू लगाने वाली स्त्री (जमादारिन) से एक तेज़ छुरी लाने को कहा। अगले दिन वह खिड़की से छुरी पहुँचा गई।

शिरगुल देव ने कहा कि जो बेड़ियाँ काटेगा, वही सबसे अधिक शक्तिशाली होगा और सर्वत्र पूजित होगा। गुग्गा पीर ने छुरी मुँह में पकड़कर शिरगुल देव की बेड़ियाँ काटीं। शीघ्र ही सभी मुक्त हो गए और वहाँ से निकल पड़े।

पीपल के वृक्ष के समीप खुले मैदान में तुर्क सैनिकों ने आक्रमण किया। शिरगुल देव ने भूमि से धूल फेंकी, जिससे सैनिक एक-दूसरे को शत्रु समझने लगे और आपस में ही युद्ध कर मारे गए। शिरगुल देव और उनके साथी सुरक्षित रहे।

भयभीत होकर तुर्क शासकों ने क्षमा माँगी, जिसे शिरगुल देव ने स्वीकार कर लिया। उसी समय चूड़धार से एक शिलालेख रूपी संदेश आया कि वहाँ फिर संकट उत्पन्न हो गया है। शिरगुल देव ने शीघ्र लौटने की बात कही।

तुर्कों ने उन्हें घोड़े भेंट किए। शिरगुल देव को चितकबरी घोड़ी मिली। प्रस्थान के समय शिरगुल की बहन भांग भी प्रकट हुई और साथ चलने की ज़िद की। शिरगुल देव ने उसकी ओर मिट्टी की चुटकी फेंकी, जिससे उसे दिव्य शक्ति प्राप्त हुई। जहाँ-जहाँ वह गई, प्राणी तत्काल नष्ट होने लगे। यह देखकर शिरगुल देव ने उसकी शक्ति वापस ले ली और उसे चेतावनी दी। उसने वचन दिया कि वह केवल बुलाए जाने पर ही प्रकट होगी।

शिरगुल देव शाया लौटे, जहाँ लोगों ने उनका स्वागत किया। पुनः चूड़धार पर आक्रमण की योजना बनी। मार्ग में अनेक दानव मारे गए। एक संकरे पर्वतीय मार्ग पर शिरगुल देव ने चितकबरी घोड़ी को पत्थर में परिवर्तित कर दिया, जिसकी आज भी पूजा होती है।

चूड़धार में चौखट दानव के साथ भयंकर युद्ध हुआ। शिरगुल देव ने तलवार से उसका सिर काट दिया। तलवार एक चट्टान से टकराई, जिसका निशान आज भी विद्यमान है। दानव का सिर वहीं गिरा, जबकि उसका धड़ छाजपुर में जा गिरा, जहाँ उसका नाम आज भी प्रचलित है।

इसके बाद चूड़धार भयमुक्त हो गया। लोग चूर-चाँदनी को तीर्थ बनाना चाहते थे, किंतु वहाँ जल नहीं था। शिरगुल देव ने मानसरोवर से जल लाकर उसे लोककल्याण हेतु पवित्र स्थान बनाया।

अपने दिव्य कार्य पूर्ण कर शिरगुल देव परमधाम को प्रस्थान कर गए। बिज्जट देव, चंद्रेश्वर देव, गुड़ाई, बिजई और भंगायणी अपने-अपने स्थानों पर प्रतिष्ठित हुए। मंदिर बने, मूर्तियाँ स्थापित हुईं और पूजा आरंभ हुई। लोग भूत-प्रेत और काली शक्तियों के भय से मुक्त हुए।

कालांतर में खिलजी, तुगलक आदि शासक आए-गए। अनेक मंदिर नष्ट हुए और मूर्तियाँ भूमिगत कर दी गईं। शेरशाह सूरी के बाद मंदिरों का पुनर्निर्माण हुआ, मूर्तियाँ पुनः प्राप्त हुईं और पूजा फिर से आरंभ हुई। आज भी बिज्जट महाराज, गुड़ाई, बिजई, शिरगुल देव और चंद्रेश्वर देव की मूर्तियाँ गुफाओं और खेतों से प्राप्त हुई हैं, जहाँ मंदिर स्थापित हैं और निरंतर पूजा-अर्चना होती है।
